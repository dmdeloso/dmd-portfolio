                NU Asian Magazine (stylized as NUAZN) is Northwestern's only Asian-interest publication. During Summer 2020, I joined staff as webmaster and developed the magazine's website.

            How do you start college remotely? I spoke to incoming Northwestern students about their experience finding community virtually after the university announced most of them would not be allowed on campus. I built the interactive components over the course of a week, using JavaScript and JQuery to simulate an email notification and a text group chat for dramatic effect.
